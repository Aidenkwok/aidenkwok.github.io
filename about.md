![test]({{ "/assets/img/aiden.jpg" }})


I'm Aiden, a front end developer and graphic designer, currently studying my final year of graphic design at Edinburgh College of Art.

I enjoy exploring the space between design and technology, and when I'm not in the designing, you can find me exploring or learning something new.
